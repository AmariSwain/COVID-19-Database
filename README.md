# COVID-19-Database

Tableau Visualization - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amari.swain/viz/BasicCovidVisualizationAssignment-MastersProgramProject/Dashboard1

In this project, I'm going to be setting up a database for storing COVID-19 data using SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements. My goal is to become a pro at using a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for database installation and manipulation, which aligns with the course outcome of HI520-2.

I'll be using the CREATE and ALTER keywords to create databases, tables, columns, and keys, and putting my DML skills to the test by writing a database script. I'm also going to try out different ways to insert data into the database, including manual data entry, scripting, and importing CSV files. Finally, I'll be getting hands-on experience with modifying existing data in a table using DML commands.  

This project is the perfect chance for me to up my game and master multiple methods for creating a database and inserting data. The physical database design and CSV file provided will be my starting point, and I'll end the assignment by manually inserting, updating, and deleting data.

*This is an ongoing project and will take about 5 weeks to complete as we finish out our course manipulating the database we created in this repo. Be on the look out for anychanges that may continue to happen.*
